# Planet-Similarities-to-Earth---JUNI-Master-Project
## Intro
All of the missions searching for planets outside of the solar system have yielded impressive results with many catalogued exoplanets. I have compiled the most similar exoplanets to Earth based on radius, temperature, star type, and gravity.
## Section Summary
The first section includes comparisons to planets and moons within this solar system, while the second section includes comparisons to planets outside of the solar system, known as exoplanets. Keep in mind that the planets outside of our solar system do not have precise masses, radii, or temperatures due to their distances (lightyears) from Earth. Comments are dispersed throughout the project for explainations on units, and the functions of various methods (most of which are for calculations)
